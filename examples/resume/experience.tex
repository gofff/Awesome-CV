      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Led and owned multiple computer vision projects related to building and floorplan analysis, acting as a senior individual contributor with full technical ownership.}
        \item {Developed a building segmentation pipeline from satellite imagery, combining SAM-based masks with edge refinement and geometry-aware loss/gain fitting using primitive shapes.}
        \item {Built a PDF layout processing pipeline for extracting structured building data, combining object detection (YOLO), raw PDF vector data extraction, image-based post-processing, and LLM APIs for semantic data interpretation.}
        \item {Worked on floorplan segmentation from both vector and raster sources, including vector-based preprocessing, matching and transforming multiple representations of the same floorplan, graph-heuristic segmentation from vector data, and U-Net-based segmentation for raster images.}
        \item {Implemented backend services around the computer vision pipelines using FastAPI, exposing models and data processing workflows via production-ready APIs.}
        \item {Set up and maintained data preparation and annotation workflows, including dataset versioning and iteration using Roboflow.}
